create the react application    (JSX)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) create the react application with the following command.

> npx create-react-app first-app-jsx

    where "first-app-jsx" is the name of the react application


2) switch to react application

    > cd first-app-jsx

3) execute the react application

    > yarn start

    the default port number of react application is 3000


Day-4
*****

create the react application with "TSX" Approch

1) create the react application

    > npx create-react-app first-app-tsx --template typescript

    where "first-app-tsx" is the name of the react application


2) switch to react application

    > cd first-app-tsx

3) execute the react application

    > yarn start


Directory Structure
*******************

    - components will bind the response to "div" whose id as "root"

4) logo192.png
   logo512.png

        - these images are used to execute the react application in multiple devices with same resolution

    - we can create components in two Approches

        1) Functional 

        2) Class Level

                                    JSX
                                    ***

Single Page Application
***********************
    - loading one component to another component without refreshing the whole webpage called as single page application.

    - Navigation in Single Page Applications called as "Routing".

    - we will implement Single Page Applications with the help of "react-router-dom" package.

    - we will download "react-router-dom" module with the help of yarn tool.


    > yarn add react-router-dom
