Introduction
************

    - React is the JavaScript library.

    - React Given By Facebook.

    - React Categorized into 3 Types.

        1) ReactJS

        2) React Native

        3) React BootStrap

    - ReactJS used to build the Web Applications.

    - We will build web Applications in 2 ways.

            1) JSX

            2) TSX

    - JSX Stands for JavaScript and XML.

    - TSX Stands for TypeScript and XML.

    - JavaScript is the Scripting Language.

    - JavaScript wont follows the OOPS.

    - JavaScript is Object Based Scripting language.

    - TSX Stands for TypeScript and XML.

    - In General, Browsers can't understand XML.

    - So, we must convert XML to Equalent JavaScript.

    - Babel is the Tool, used to convert the XML to Equalent JavaScript.

    - Babel is inbuilt tool in ReactJS.

    - Visual Studio Code is Suggestable IDE, to build the React Applications.

    - Visual Studio Code also called as VSCode.

    - VSCode is the Open Source IDE and Provided by Microsoft.





    - TypeScript is the Programming Language.

    - TypeScript given by Microsoft.

    - TypeScript follows the OOPS.

    - React Native used to build the Mobile Applications.

    - React BootStrap used to apply the styles to the both web applications and mobile applications.

    - library containes predefined functionalities.

    - to use libraries no need to follow any rules and regulations.

    Ex.
        ReactJS

        jQuery

Installation of ReactJS


1) download and install "NodeJS"

    NodeJS containes following tools.

    1) npm

    2) node

    3) npx

    ----
    ----
    ----

    npm stands for "node packaging manager".

    npm helps to install "ReactJS".

    node tool helps to execute the "JavaScript".

    npx stands for "node packaging runner".

    npx helps to create the environment to "build react applications".

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v14.17.6-x64.msi


2) install yarn tool

    yarn tool given by Facebook.

    yarn tool used to download the libraries.

    we will install yarn tool by using following command.

    > npm install -g yarn

    -g stands for global Installation.


3) install create-react-app tool

    create-react-app tool given by Facebook

    create-react-app tool, used to create the react applications.

    > npm install -g create-react-app


4) install visual studio Code

    visual studio code is the "IDE".

    visual studio code also called as "VSCode".

    VSCode given by "Microsoft".

    VSCode is the "open source IDE".

website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.60.2.exe

create the react application    (JSX)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) create the react application with the following command.

> npx create-react-app first-app-jsx

    where "first-app-jsx" is the name of the react application


2) switch to react application

    > cd first-app-jsx

3) execute the react application

    > yarn start

    the default port number of react application is 3000


Day-4
*****

create the react application with "TSX" Approch

1) create the react application

    > npx create-react-app first-app-tsx --template typescript

    where "first-app-tsx" is the name of the react application


2) switch to react application

    > cd first-app-tsx

3) execute the react application

    > yarn start


Directory Structure
*******************

1) node_modules

        - it containes libraries, these libraries helps to execute the react application.

2) public/favicon.ico

     - this logo representing default logo of react.

3) public/index.html

    - react library starts the execution from index.html file.

    - index.html file is the "main" template.

    - index.html file containes "div" with id as "root".

    - components will bind the response to "div" whose id as "root"

4) logo192.png
   logo512.png

        - these images are used to execute the react application in multiple devices with same resolution

5) manifest.json

        - used to configure the mobile application development.


6) src /  App.js
          App.css
          App.test.js

          when ever we create the react application automatically App is the default component.


7) src / index.css

    used to define the global styles

    these styles applicable to entire react application

8) src/logo.svg

    logo.svg is the default svg logo of react application.

    svg logos have more resolution.

9) reportWebVitals.js
        &
   setupTests.js

    these two files behaves like libraries

    these libraries helps to write the test cases


10) .gitignore

    used to stop the libraries to Repositories


11) package.json

    used to download the 3rd party libraries.


12) src/index.js

    used to register the components


Virtual DOM
***********
    DOM stands for "Document Object Model".

    DOM will create by "Browser Engine".

    when ever HTML Loaded into Browser Engine, Browser Engine will create "DOM" Object.

    DOM Object Internally containes "Tree Structure", That Tree Structure Technically called as "DOM Tree Structure".

    Navigation in DOM Object called as "DOM Traversing".


                                        components
                                        **********
    - reusable portion of complex ui called as "component".

    - as a react developer, we can create more than "one component".

    - as a react developer, we can privide communication between one component to another component.

    - as a react developer, we can create components in two languages.

    1) JSX   (JavaScript  and XML)

    2) TSX    (TypeScript and XML )

    - we can create components in two Approches

        1) Functional 

        2) Class Level

                                    JSX
                                    ***

    > npx create-react-app component-app-jsx

                      index.js
    ***************************************

state
*****
    - "state" representing "component" data.

    - "state" is the predefined object in react library.

********************************************

making the rest api calls
-------------------------

axios is the 3rd party library, used to make the asynchronous calls.

    > yarn add axios

Single Page Application
***********************
    - loading one component to another component without refreshing the whole webpage called as single page application.

    - Navigation in Single Page Applications called as "Routing".

    - we will implement Single Page Applications with the help of "react-router-dom" package.

    - we will download "react-router-dom" module with the help of yarn tool.


    > yarn add react-router-dom


**********************************

         Pagetwo.js

         Pagethree.js
***********************************






Middlewares / State Management
******************************
    - React Applications are "component" based applications.

    - As a React developer, we can create more than "one" component.

    - As react developer, we can provide communication between components.

            1) state & props

            2) events

    - communication between components are difficult, if application complexity increses.

    - to simplify communication between components, we will use common storage (state).

    - we will implement above common storage by using state management.

    - we will implement state management by using following middlewares.

            1) redux

            2) thunk

            3) saga
